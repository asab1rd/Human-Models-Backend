Take your time to thoroughly understand my request: $ARGUMENTS.

I want to ensure you have a complete grasp of my actual problem and the objective I'm trying to achieve. To accomplish this, I need you to:

1. Clearly articulate my objective
2. Reformulate my problem statement in a concise manner using bullet points
3. Show me an ASCII diagram illustrating the current state, followed by another ASCII diagram showing the target state
4. If anything remains unclear, ask specific clarifying questions to resolve ambiguities

Please provide your response only after you have gathered all necessary context and information - do not respond incrementally or piecemeal.
